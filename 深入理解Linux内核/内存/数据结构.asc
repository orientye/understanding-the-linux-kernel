▪ NUMA系统上每个NUMA节点拥有一个pglist_data结构来描述内存布局
	
	NODE_DATA(nid)

▪ UMA系统用一个pglist_data结构来描述整个内存布局

▪ pglist_data划分为zone

▪ node_states: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/nodemask.h

=== zone

▪ 由于硬件的限制，需要把页划分成区

    ▪ 某些硬件只能通过某些特定的内存地址来执行直接内存访问
    ▪ 一些体系结构的内存物理寻址范围比虚拟寻址范围大，于是某些内存就不能永久地映射到内核空间上

▪ 不是所有体系结构都定义了全部区, 如X86-64没有ZONE_HIGHMEM

	/*
	 * ZONE_MOVABLE is similar to ZONE_NORMAL, except that it contains
	 * movable pages with few exceptional cases described below. Main use
	 * cases for ZONE_MOVABLE are to make memory offlining/unplug more
	 * likely to succeed, and to locally limit unmovable allocations - e.g.,
	 * to increase the number of THP/huge pages. Notable special cases are:
	 *
	 * 1. Pinned pages: (long-term) pinning of movable pages might
	 *    essentially turn such pages unmovable. Therefore, we do not allow
	 *    pinning long-term pages in ZONE_MOVABLE. When pages are pinned and
	 *    faulted, they come from the right zone right away. However, it is
	 *    still possible that address space already has pages in
	 *    ZONE_MOVABLE at the time when pages are pinned (i.e. user has
	 *    touches that memory before pinning). In such case we migrate them
	 *    to a different zone. When migration fails - pinning fails.
	 * 2. memblock allocations: kernelcore/movablecore setups might create
	 *    situations where ZONE_MOVABLE contains unmovable allocations
	 *    after boot. Memory offlining and allocations fail early.
	 * 3. Memory holes: kernelcore/movablecore setups might create very rare
	 *    situations where ZONE_MOVABLE contains memory holes after boot,
	 *    for example, if we have sections that are only partially
	 *    populated. Memory offlining and allocations fail early.
	 * 4. PG_hwpoison pages: while poisoned pages can be skipped during
	 *    memory offlining, such pages cannot be allocated.
	 * 5. Unmovable PG_offline pages: in paravirtualized environments,
	 *    hotplugged memory blocks might only partially be managed by the
	 *    buddy (e.g., via XEN-balloon, Hyper-V balloon, virtio-mem). The
	 *    parts not manged by the buddy are unmovable PG_offline pages. In
	 *    some cases (virtio-mem), such pages can be skipped during
	 *    memory offlining, however, cannot be moved/allocated. These
	 *    techniques might use alloc_contig_range() to hide previously
	 *    exposed pages from the buddy again (e.g., to implement some sort
	 *    of memory unplug in virtio-mem).
	 * 6. ZERO_PAGE(0), kernelcore/movablecore setups might create
	 *    situations where ZERO_PAGE(0) which is allocated differently
	 *    on different platforms may end up in a movable zone. ZERO_PAGE(0)
	 *    cannot be migrated.
	 * 7. Memory-hotplug: when using memmap_on_memory and onlining the
	 *    memory to the MOVABLE zone, the vmemmap pages are also placed in
	 *    such zone. Such pages cannot be really moved around as they are
	 *    self-stored in the range, but they are treated as movable when
	 *    the range they describe is about to be offlined.
	 *
	 * In general, no unmovable allocations that degrade memory offlining
	 * should end up in ZONE_MOVABLE. Allocators (like alloc_contig_range())
	 * have to expect that migrating pages in ZONE_MOVABLE can fail (even
	 * if has_unmovable_pages() states that there are no unmovable pages,
	 * there can be false negatives).
